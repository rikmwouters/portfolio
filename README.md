Rapento - Entomological Database (C#/Delphi/SQL)

In this project, I'm building a database with interface for entomologists to save their collections' data in. The project is currently mainly meant as a practicing playground for learning to program. I'm building UI's in both C# and Delphi, for the sake of learning the two languages and learning about their differences. The program might end up with various functionalities eventually, but I aim primarily at creating a simple means of inserting and retrieving data from the database.

An important part of the project is also the SQL database scripts. While in development, the scripts are made to build and rebuild the database, instead of altering it. Alterations to the tables, for example, are currently done by dropping all tables and creating them with the new DDL script.

Sudoku Solver (C#)

For my C# Sudoku Solver project, check out my SudokuSolver repository. The program lacks a UI, but can be provided with a string within the code that represents a yet-to-be-filled sudoku sheet. The game will then be completed and the filled in sudoku sheet will be printed in the console. I tried to make the program as object-oriented as is practically useful.

Mancala (Java)

For my Java project Mancala, check out my repository Mancala. Mancala is an ancient two-player boardgame with interesting mechanics for practicing object-oriented programming. I built it in MVC structure.
