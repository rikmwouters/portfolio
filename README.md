Entomological Database (SQL)

For my SQL project, check out my repository EntomologicalDatabase. In this project, I have created all SQL scripts to create a database to store data about entomological collections. While in development, the scripts are made to build and rebuild the database, instead of altering it. Alterations to the tables, for example, are currently done by dropping all tables and creating them with the new DDL script.

Mancala (Java)

For my Java project Mancala, check out my repository Mancala. Mancala is an ancient two-player boardgame with interesting mechanics for practicing object-oriented programming. I built it in MVC structure.

Sudoku Solver (C#)

For my C# Sudoku Solver project, check out my SudokuSolver repository. The program lacks a UI, but can be provided with a string within the code that represents a yet-to-be-filled sudoku sheet. The game will then be completed and the filled in sudoku sheet will be printed in the console. I tried to make the program as object-oriented as is practically useful.
